Included are the scripts we used to perform
our analysis on whether Ernst-based classes  emerge
closely in various embedding spaces.

Included are the Python Scripts:
w2txt.py and embed2word2vec.py -- The first two scripts were mostly for processing our embedding files into similar formats
We used the gensim library to convert our word2vec embedding file from .bin to .txt format.
We also used the gensim library to change both dependency and glove embedding types into 
the word2vec format,so they could be run with gensim

cos_sim.py -- In this script we loaded each embedding file as a model in gensim, so that we could run cosine
similarity based on our dictionary of Ernst classes

precision_recall.py and run_pr.py -- We used the next two scripts to evaluate our results from running cosine similarity
on our embedding types. We also plotted the results using pylab and code publicly available and borrow from:
